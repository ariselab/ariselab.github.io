description: I am primarily interested in Software Engineering research with a focus on improving software reliability and security. In particular, I devise novel program analysis techniques to analyze existing code properties and apply advanced machine learning models to learn from those properties. Such models help me building tools that automate program development, bug detection, and program repair for real-world large scale software.
